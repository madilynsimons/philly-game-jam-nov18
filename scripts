-So how did you end up here anyways?
-You woke up here!  How mysterious!  Perhaps it's destiny that you ended up here.  Or maybe other forces are at play...
-I traveled a great distance to be here.  I swam through oceans, crossed deserts, fought countless monsters.
-It was only the memory of my mother and her strength that got me through this journey.  All I had to remember her was this locket she gave me when I was little, but it shattered.  I still carry the remaining pieces with me.

*give jewlery glue*
-Jewlery glue?  Now I can put together my mother's necklace!  Thank you.  Here, maybe you'll be able to find strength in this gift like I found strength in my mother's gift.
